Analysis:
Tesla's Q2 2025 performance shows mixed results amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. Key metrics:
| Category                  | Q2 2025   | YoY Change |
|---------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Total Revenue            | $22.5B    | -12%       |
| Automotive Revenue       | $16.7B    | -16%       |
| Energy Generation & Storage Revenue | $2.8B | -7%  |
| Services & Other Revenue | $3.0B     | +17%       |
| GAAP Operating Income    | $0.9B     | -42%       |
| GAAP Net Income          | $1.2B     | -16%       |
| Non-GAAP Net Income      | $1.4B     | -23%       |
| Operating Cash Flow      | $2.5B     | -30%       |
| Free Cash Flow           | $0.1B     | -89%       |
| Cash & Investments       | $36.8B    | +20%       |
| Vehicle Production       | 410,244 units | 0%    |
| Vehicle Deliveries       | 384,122 units | -13%  |

Trends: Revenue decline primarily from lower vehicle deliveries and ASP, offset by services growth. Profitability pressured by increased R&D in AI, but cost reductions per vehicle helped. Strong cash position supports investments. Market context: EV demand softening due to tariffs and policy uncertainties, but Tesla leads in autonomy.

Investment Recommendations:
- Hold TSLA stock: Despite revenue drop, strong liquidity ($36.8B) and AI/robotics focus offer growth potential; EPS met expectations but stock dipped post-earnings.
- Pros: Diversified revenue (services up 17%), leadership in autonomy (Robotaxi launch), affordable model ramp in H2 2025.
- Cons: Declining deliveries (-13% YoY), margin pressure from tariffs, political risks.
- Suggested Strategies: Diversify portfolio with 15-20% TSLA allocation; monitor Robotaxi and Cybercab progress for 2026; consider long-term buy if AI profits materialize.

Risk Assessment:
- Identified Risks: Macroeconomic uncertainty (tariffs, fiscal policies), supply chain disruptions, EV demand slowdown, high R&D costs impacting short-term profitability; carbon credit margins and political sentiment risks.
- Mitigation Plans: Leverage strong cash reserves for investments; expand energy business for diversification; focus on cost reductions and autonomy to differentiate from competitors; monitor policy changes closely.
